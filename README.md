# PROJECT NAME

Feedback Loop

## Description

_Duration: Weekend Project_

This project is designed to intake user feedback input on separate pages and store the feedback in a database.

### Prerequisites

Link to software that is required to install the app (e.g. node).

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro)
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
- [Material UI](https://v4.mui.com/)
- [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

## Installation

1. Create a database named `prime_feedback`,
2. The queries in the `data.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries.
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `postgres -D /usr/local/var/postgres for Intel, M1 is postgres -D /opt/homebrew/var/postgres` in your terminal
to start the database
5. Run `npm run server` in your terminal to start the server.
6. Run `npm run client` in your terminal to open the client.


## Usage

Follow the prompts to submit feedback based on the required criteria.
